**Claude Sonnet 4.5** marks a significant upgrade for developers building agents, writing code, and solving complex problems. This release is not just about better performance, it’s about giving developers the same building blocks Anthropic uses internally to power Claude Code.

## Why Developers Should Care

Claude Sonnet 4.5 delivers stronger coding ability, sharper reasoning, and more robust alignment. On **SWE-bench Verified**, it leads in real-world software engineering tasks. On **OSWorld**, which measures real-world computer use, performance jumped from 42.2% to 61.4% in just four months.

For developers, this translates to:

* More reliable code generation across large projects
    
* Better handling of long-running tasks (focus sustained over 30+ hours)
    
* Stronger math and reasoning capabilities for complex logic
    

## Key Updates for Developers

### Claude Code

* **Checkpoints**: Save and roll back progress instantly
    
* **Refreshed terminal interface**: Cleaner workflow for debugging and iteration
    
* **Native VS Code extension**: Seamless coding inside your editor
    

### Claude Agent SDK

The biggest news for developers is the **Claude Agent SDK**. This is the same infrastructure that powers Claude Code, now available for you:

* Memory management for long-running tasks
    
* Permission systems balancing autonomy with user control
    
* Coordination tools for multi-agent workflows
    

This means you can build your own advanced agents with the same foundation Anthropic uses.

### Expanded App Capabilities

Claude apps now support:

* **Code execution** directly inside conversations
    
* **File creation** (spreadsheets, slides, documents)
    

Developers can now prototype, test, and iterate faster without leaving the chat.

## Safety and Alignment

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is released under **AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3)**. Improvements include:

* Stronger defenses against **prompt injection attacks**
    
* Reduced misaligned behaviors like deception or sycophancy
    
* Better classifier performance with fewer false positives
    

For developers building production systems, this means stronger reliability and reduced risk.

## Bonus: Imagine with Claude

A temporary research preview, **Imagine with Claude**, demonstrates real-time code generation. No prewritten functionality, everything is created live. It’s a glimpse into what’s possible when powerful models are paired with flexible infrastructure.

## Getting Started

* API access: Use `claude-sonnet-4-5` via the Claude API
    
* Pricing: Same as Claude Sonnet 4 ($3 / $15 per million tokens)
    
* SDK + Code updates: Available now on the developer platform
    

### Final Take

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is a drop-in upgrade that boosts performance without raising costs. For developers, the **Claude Agent SDK** and expanded **Claude Code** features make this release one of the most important yet.

If you’re building agents, writing complex code, or experimenting with long-running workflows—Claude Sonnet 4.5 gives you the tools to go further.
