In this Beginner-Friendly guide, you'll learn how to build and deploy your personal website without writing much code yourself, using the power of AI (ChatGPT), no-code tools (Bolt.new), and free hosting (Netlify). Perfect for students starting out!

## **Step 1:** Generate Your PRD Using ChatGPT

Before building a website, you need a **Product Requirement Document (PRD)**. This helps AI tools like Bolt understand what kind of website you want.

### Prompt to use in ChatGPT:

```markdown
Create a PRD for a personal portfolio website. It should include a homepage, about section, projects section, contact form, and be responsive with a clean design.
```

### Sample Output:

> **Title:** Personal Portfolio Website  
> **Sections:**
> 
> * **Home:** Name, photo, short intro
>     
> * **About:** Brief background, education
>     
> * **Projects:** Three project cards with title, image, and description
>     
> * **Contact:** Email, LinkedIn, GitHub
>     
> * **Design:** Minimal, responsive layout with smooth navigation
>     

Copy this PRD to your clipboard.

## Step 2: Generate the Website Code using Bolt.New

Bolt uses AI to generate website code from your PRD.

Steps:

1. Go to [https://bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
    
2. Paste the PRD into the editor.
    
3. Click on “Generate Project.”
    
4. Once the build is complete, click “Download Project.”
    

This will download a .zip file containing the website’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Step 3: Extract the Project

1. Locate the downloaded ZIP file (e.g., `portfolio.zip`).
    
2. Right-click &gt; **Extract All**.
    
3. Save it in a location you can access easily (e.g., Desktop or Documents).
    

This folder contains your website files ready to be published.

## Step 4: Install Git and Set Up GitHub

You’ll now set up version control and get ready to host your code on GitHub.

### Install Git:

* Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    
* Run the installer and keep default settings
    
* After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and verify:
    

```bash
git --version
```

### [C](https://git-scm.com/downloads)reate a GitHub Account[:](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
    
2. Sign up and verify your email
    
3. Click **“+” &gt; New Repository**
    
4. Name the repo `personal-website` and keep it **public**
    
5. Do not initialize with a README — leave it blank
    

## Step 5: Open the Project in VS Code and Push to GitHub

### Open VS Code:

* Download it from [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
    
* Open the extracted folder using **File &gt; Open Folde**[**r**](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    

### Initialize Git in the VS [Code Terminal:](https://github.com)

Use the terminal in VS Code (shortcut: `Ctrl +` \`) and run:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/personal-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

> Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with y[our actual GitHub](https://github.com) [user](https://code.visualstudio.com)name[.](https://code.visualstudio.com)

Your code is now live [on GitHub.](https://github.com)

## Step 6 : Deploy Your Website on Netlify

Netlify is a platform that lets you deploy static websites for free.

### Set Up:

1. Visit [https://www.netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com)
    
2. Sign up using your GitHub account and authorize it
    
3. Click **“Add New Site” &gt; Import from Git**
    
4. Select your `personal-website` repository
    
5. Leave build settings as default (Netlify auto-detects them)
    
6. Click **Deploy**
    

After a few seconds, your website will be live at a `.netlify.app` domain.

You can change this domain in Site Settings &gt; Domain Management.

## Step 7: Improve Your Site

* Update content inside `index.html` or `about.tsx`
    
* Customize the design with CSS in the `style.css` file
    
* Attach your resume as a PDF download
    

## Conclusion

This project is designed as a beginner-friendly pathway to **learn Git and cloud deployment** without needing to write code from scratch. By leveraging tools like ChatGPT, Bolt.new, GitHub, and Netlify, students can focus purely on understanding **version control**, **repository management**, and **cloud hosting workflows**.

If your goal is to **learn Git commands, GitHub workflow, and deploy projects on platforms like Netlify** this is the perfect hands-on project. You can skip the coding part and still walk away with real-world DevOps and cloud deployment experience. Use this as a stepping stone to build confidence in modern developer tools.
