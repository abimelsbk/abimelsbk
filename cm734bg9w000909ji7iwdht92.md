Mobile applications play a crucial role in today’s digital landscape, handling vast amounts of sensitive user data. However, improper security implementations can expose users to data breaches, privacy violations, and cyber threats. This technical blog analyzes multiple security flaws in the DeepSeek iOS app, focusing on encryption vulnerabilities, insecure data storage, fingerprinting risks, and network traffic concerns.

## **1\. Insecure Symmetric Encryption with Hardcoded Keys**

### **Encryption is Only as Strong as Its Implementation**

Encryption is a fundamental mechanism to protect data confidentiality and integrity. However, improper implementation can render it ineffective. The DeepSeek iOS app exhibits several weaknesses in its encryption approach:

* **Use of a broken encryption algorithm (3DES)**: The app employs **Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)**, which is **deprecated due to known vulnerabilities** and **susceptible to brute-force attacks**.
    
* **Hardcoded encryption key**: The encryption key is hardcoded within the app, making it easily retrievable through reverse engineering.
    
* **Use of NIL for Initialization Vector (IV)**: The absence of a random IV reduces the encryption strength, making ciphertext predictable.
    
* **Reuse of IV**: If an IV is reused across multiple encryption instances, it significantly weakens security by allowing attackers to correlate encrypted data.
    

### **Reverse Engineering Analysis**

Using **r2ai** (an AI-enhanced reverse engineering tool for radare2) and **Frida** (a binary instrumentation framework), security researchers analyzed the encryption function in the `BDAutoTrackLocalConfigService` service, particularly the `saveUser` call.

#### **Frida Hook Output of Encryption Function**

```javascript
plaintextCopyEdit================ CCCrypt Call ================
Operation => kCCDecrypt
Algorithm => kCCAlgorithm3DES
Options => kCCOptionPKCS7Padding
Key size => 24
Key => MEMyNyRTU2
IV => None
Data input => 4pvOAF6luXJQ==
Data output => NjRjOWxNmFk
```

This confirms the use of an insecure symmetric encryption algorithm with a **hardcoded key and missing IV**, making the encryption ineffective against real-world attacks.

## **2\. Insecure Data Storage: Username, Password, and Encryption Keys**

### **Cached Sensitive Data in Local Storage**

Analysis of the DeepSeek iOS app revealed that **user credentials and encryption keys were stored insecurely** in a cached database on the device. In scenarios where an attacker gains physical access to an unlocked device, this data can be **easily extracted and exploited**.

### **NSURLRequest API Caching Issue**

The app uses **NSURLRequest API** to communicate with remote servers. By default, this API caches HTTP responses in a `Cache.db` file **unless explicitly disabled by developers**. This means **sensitive data remains stored locally**, creating a serious security risk.

## **3\. Data Collection and Fingerprinting Risks**

### **Fingerprinting: The Silent Privacy Violation**

Modern mobile applications track user behavior, device information, and network metadata. While some tracking is necessary for app functionality, excessive data collection can pose **serious privacy risks**, particularly when combined with external data sources.

### **How Minimal Data Can Lead to Identity Exposure**

Even seemingly harmless data points can reveal a user’s identity when correlated with other datasets. Consider the following scenario:

**User 1** asks: *"What Elements Are Commonly Used as Nanoparticles?"*

* Data suggests they are a student researching nanotechnology.
    

**User 2** asks the same question but:

* Uses a **high-end iPad**
    
* Is connected via **FirstNet (a U.S. public safety broadband network)**
    
* Uses a **cellular data connection**
    

These additional data points may categorize **User 2 as a high-value target**, increasing the risk of surveillance or cyber espionage.

### **Data Points Collected by the App**

DeepSeek iOS collects extensive user data, including:

* **Device name** (potentially containing real names)
    
* **OS version**
    
* **Language settings**
    
* **Network connection type (WiFi, Cellular, VPN, etc.)**
    
* **App usage statistics**
    

Such data can be **combined across multiple apps**, making it easy to de-anonymize users and track them across different services.

## **4\. Data Transmission to ByteDance's Volcengine**

### **What Is Volcengine?**

Volcengine is **ByteDance’s cloud service platform**, used for AI, analytics, and enterprise solutions. While ByteDance is headquartered in China, its cloud infrastructure spans multiple countries, leading to concerns about **data sovereignty and access by foreign governments**.

### **Network Analysis of Data Transmission**

The DeepSeek app transmits sensitive user data to [**https://apmplus.volces.com/monitor/collect/c/performance/**](https://apmplus.volces.com/monitor/collect/c/performance/). Key concerns include:

* **Volcengine’s connection to ByteDance**: Data sent here could be accessed under Chinese data laws.
    
* **Fingerprinting data (e.g., device name)**: This allows **direct association between users and their devices**, reducing anonymity.
    

## **5\. Third-Party Data Sharing: Intercom SDK**

The app integrates **Intercom's iOS SDK**, which further transmits user data to an external platform. Security researchers identified **fingerprinting vectors** in this data exchange, such as:

* **Color scheme tracking**
    
* **Voice-over feature status** (used for accessibility tracking)
    
* **Left-to-right (LTR) language setting**
    

These attributes may **seem harmless** but contribute to **building a highly unique user fingerprint**, enabling tracking across multiple apps and services.

## **6\. Missing iOS Security Controls**

### **iOS Security Protections Ignored**

Apple provides various security features to protect app users, but DeepSeek **fails to leverage them properly**:

| **Security Control** | **Status in DeepSeek iOS App** | **Risk** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **App Transport Security (ATS)** | **Globally disabled** | Allows unencrypted data transmission |
| **Privacy Manifest Disclosure** | **Not properly declared** | Fingerprinting APIs not disclosed |
| **Data Encryption Best Practices** | **Violated** | Weak encryption (3DES, hardcoded key, missing IV) |
| **User Defaults API Usage** | **Misused for fingerprinting** | Risk of user tracking |

## **7\. Network Traffic and Chinese Data Access Concerns**

### **Traffic Routing Through U.S.-Based ByteDance Servers**

While DeepSeek app’s network logs show data routing through U.S. IP addresses, **reverse analysis reveals ByteDance ownership**.

#### **Example: DNS Resolution of ByteDance Server**

```javascript
plaintextCopyEditping apmplus.volces.com
PING apmplus.volces.com.queniusz.com (8.45.52.229)
```

* **Geo-located in the U.S.**
    
* **Owned by Level 3 Communications (acquired by Lumen)**
    
* **Connected to ByteDance (China-based parent company of TikTok and Volcengine)**
    

### **Implications for Enterprises and Government Agencies**

Organizations using DeepSeek risk exposing:

* **Intellectual Property** (through AI model usage data)
    
* **Government or Military Personnel Data** (through device fingerprinting)
    
* **User Privacy** (via metadata tracking and third-party data sharing)
    

## **Conclusion: Why This Matters & Next Steps**

The DeepSeek iOS app demonstrates **critical security flaws** that impact user data confidentiality, integrity, and privacy. Key takeaways include:

* **Weak encryption** (3DES, hardcoded key, missing IV) compromises data security.
    
* **Insecure storage of sensitive data** (credentials, encryption keys) increases attack risks.
    
* **Fingerprinting and data tracking** pose **serious privacy concerns**.
    
* **Data transmission to ByteDance servers** raises **geopolitical and regulatory risks**.
    

### **Recommendations for Developers**

To address these risks, developers should:

* **Use modern encryption standards (AES-256) with dynamic IVs and secure key storage.**
    
* **Disable automatic caching for sensitive data using NSURLRequest.**
    
* **Limit data collection and disclose API usage per Apple’s privacy policies.**
    
* **Implement App Transport Security (ATS) to enforce encrypted data transmission.**
    

### **Final Thought**

Security is not just about compliance; it's about **protecting users from real-world threats**. Apps like DeepSeek highlight the importance of **thorough security testing** before deployment. Enterprises and users must remain vigilant, ensuring that the apps they rely on **respect both security best practices and user privacy**.
